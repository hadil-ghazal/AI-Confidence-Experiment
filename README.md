# AI-Confidence-Experiment
Statistical analysis of how AI suggestions influence human reasoning accuracy and confidence in decision making tasks

## Project Overview 

This project explores how AI generate suggestions can influence a user's accuracy in answering trivia and is meant to analyze whether someone is more or less confident with their answers and if their accuracy

The survey was intentionally designed with inaccuracy built into the AI suggestions - at a 50% accuracy

## Hypothesis
**Null Hypothesis** - There is no difference in average accuracy or confidence between AI-Assisted and unassisted trivia responses
**Alternative Hypothesis** - AI assistance influences average accuracy and/or confidence

##Experiment Design and power analysis

Power analysis determined 

Test Taker Group 1 - Completing Buckets 1 and 2
Category 1: Trivia A with no AI assistance - explicitly asking the test taker to refrain from using any outside help or research and encouraging honesty over correctness
Category 2: Trivia B with AI assistance  - "AI generated answers" were pasted into each question, and the AI suggestions were intentionally incorrect in half of the questions
