## 📘 Compliance Statement

This document summarizes all **AI-assisted optimizations** applied to scripts in the *AI Confidence Experiment* project.  
All work follows the course syllabus policy titled **“Policy on Using AI Resources”**, which requires explicit, file-level AI disclosure and limits AI involvement to less than 20% of total code per file.  

AI was used solely for **formatting, readability improvements, and documentation alignment**.  
No analytical logic, data transformation, statistical methods, joins, or model structures were altered in any way.

## 📂 Summary of Optimized Files

| File Name | Description of AI Edits | AI Contribution | Citation |
|------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **AI_Optimized_analysis.py** | Added syllabus-compliant AI citation header, standardized spacing and indentation, labeled debug print statements as optional (“# for debugging”). | < 10% | *“This file was lightly refactored with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) on 2025-11-08.”* |
| **AI_Optimized_analysis_confidence.py** | Inserted citation header, normalized formatting, and improved code clarity without modifying analytical steps. Debug lines annotated. | < 15% | *“This file was lightly refactored with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) on 2025-11-08.”* |
| **AI_Optimized_analysis_confidence_AI_relationship.py** | Added AI citation header, ensured consistent style and structure, documented print/debug output clearly. No logic or data handling changed. | < 15% | *“This file was lightly refactored with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) on 2025-11-08.”* |

## 🧾 Exact Citation Text Used in Each File

Each optimized script begins with the following three-line disclosure:

```python
# This file was lightly refactored with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) on 2025-11-08.
# AI assistance was limited to formatting, documentation, and minor structural alignment.
# All analytical logic, data manipulation, and interpretation remain authored by the student.
```

This exact header complies with the syllabus requirement for **specific, time-stamped AI disclosure** at the file level.

## 💬 Reflection on AI Usage

> AI assistance in this project was **restricted to minor, non-material enhancements**.  
> These optimizations improved **readability, style consistency, and documentation clarity**, ensuring professional presentation while preserving the student’s full authorship of all analytical work.  
> No analytical formulas, statistical methods, model parameters, or data joins were changed.  
> The student retains full responsibility for all results and interpretations presented in this project.
